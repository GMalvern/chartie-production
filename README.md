👩🏽‍🏫 Created For Teachers, By a Teacher

Chartie was designed to help educators:

Save time

Stay organized

Produce high-quality visuals

Support student learning

Reduce prep stress

It was built with teachers in mind — especially those who juggle multiple preps, heavy grading loads, and daily lesson adjustments.

“If it’s up, it’s stuck” means:
When anchor charts stay visible, the learning stays with students.
